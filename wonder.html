<i>Wonder is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer Shawn Mendes. It was released by Island Records on December 4, 2020. Its production was handled by Mendes, Frank Dukes, Kid Harpoon and Scott Harris, among others.[2] The album was preceded by Shawn Mendes: In Wonder, a 2020 Netflix documentary capturing Mendes' off-stage life.
Upon release, Wonder received generally favourable reviews from music critics, most of whom noted Mendes' vocal improvements, but were polarized over the album's production and songwriting, deeming them predictable and formulaic. Wonder debuted at number one in Canada and the United States. Three singles supported the album: "Wonder", "Monster" with Justin Bieber, and "Call My Friends", with the former two reaching the top 20 of the US Billboard Hot 100.[3][4] The album's lead single, "Wonder," peaked at number 18 on the Hot 100, and reached the top ten in several other countries. The second single, "Monster," reached number eight on the US Hot 100 and topped the Canadian Hot 100. To promote the album, Mendes embarked on the Wonder World Tour, which commenced in June 2022 in Portland and was set to conclude in August 2023 in Dublin, before Mendes prematurely ended the tour in July 2022 due to mental health issues.</i><br><br><br>
